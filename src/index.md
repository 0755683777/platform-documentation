# Core Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation of the Core Editor, the Metaverse building tool that allows you to share worlds, and to create art, events, and components for the whole Core community.

## Core Features

- **Community collaboration**: Bolster your creation with objects, scripts, and games shared by other Core Creators.
- **The tools you need**: VFX, audio, materials, textures, skyboxes, terrain sculpting, heightmaps, scripting, and an expansive list of features in the works.
- **Web3 integration**: Create objects, areas, and experiences based on blockchain data.
